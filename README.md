[Documentation](http://easyctf.github.io/openctf/)

OpenCTF is a framework for running CTF (capture-the-flag) competitions. The name OpenCTF comes from the platform used to run EasyCTF, but has since been [rewritten into Rust](https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR). As such, it's made with performance in mind, while also aiming to be as flexible as possible.
