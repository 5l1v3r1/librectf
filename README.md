[Documentation](http://easyctf.github.io/openctf/)

OpenCTF is a framework for running CTF (capture-the-flag) competitions. The name OpenCTF comes from the platform used to run EasyCTF, but has since been [rewritten into Rust](https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR). As such, it's made with performance in mind, while also aiming to be as flexible as possible.

In order to run this platform, you will need a copy of [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail), a sandboxing utility. If you're not using a Docker image of this platform with nsjail included, please download and have this executable ready to run beforehand.

Status

OpenCTF is currently under development. Expect to see changes in the coming weeks!

Roadmap
-------
